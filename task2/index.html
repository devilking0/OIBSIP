    <p id="tribute-info">Robert John Downey Jr. is an American actor and producer. 
      His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed 
      by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success 
      later in his career.
      Downey began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical American 
      Passion at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for Saturday Night Live, 
      but following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced.
      <b>Despite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a "blockbuster" film. That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. In the article Ben Stiller wrote 
      for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of The Time 100, he offered an observation on
       Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office:<hr>
       <e>Yes, Downey is Iron Man, but he really is Actor Man ... In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king, the realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect.
